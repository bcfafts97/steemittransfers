#### Components
**I would be talking about the transfer page of the wallet section. The Steem and SBD section transfer page. I feel this suggestion would go a long way helping steemians and prevent future loss to steemians in the community.**

#### Proposal
**The transfer page of the wallet section has been updated a little bit with little tweaks here and there. On the transfer page we can now select previous recievers of funds and previous memos used. But previous amount sent isnt there.**
**My first suggestion would be adding previous amount of funds transferred. This would prevent errors while typing in the amount one wish to send and also cut the time at which we transfer funds by easily clicking on a previous amount transferred out.**
**My second suggestion would be the addition of a preview page. Humans are prone to make errors, no one is perfect as we can make mistakes without even knowing. So I would like to suggest a preview page for transfers is mad where we could look at the details of transfer before inputting our Active/Owner/Password Key and making the transfers.**
**The preview page would serve as a reminder before every transfer is made. Lots of steemians have lost funds due to error made while transferring. Transferring to wrong account, transferring excess funds and wrong memo used.**

**The Amount of Funds a steemian want to send should contain a previous transfer.**

**The preview page should be added below there,after the signup. We could push the *Join our amazing community to comment and rewards others* down to accommodate the preview page.**

### Benefits
- **Fast  transfer of funds**
- **Reduced errors while transferring funds**
